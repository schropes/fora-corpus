# Fora Corpus

This repository contains information about the Fora corpus, including information about requesting access, a description of the data, starter code, and models.

The corpus is described in the ACL 2024 paper "Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" by Hope Schroeder, Deb Roy, and Jad Kabbara.

## The corpus

This dataset includes 262 transcribed small group conversations over 39,000+ speaker turns.
Conversations come from 16 unique conversation collections hosted in partnership with community organizations. Conversation collection topics include city manager selection, resourcing challenges in NYC during COVID-19, and challenges to a school district.

## Fora annotations

Over 25% of the data has been manually annotated for two types of personal sharing, and seven defined facilitation strategies.
More information on the process and definitions will be available here soon.
