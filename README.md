# Fora Corpus

This repository contains information about the Fora corpus, including a description of the data, information about requesting access, starter code, and models for processing the data.

The corpus is described in the ACL 2024 paper "Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" by Hope Schroeder, Deb Roy, and Jad Kabbara.

## The corpus

This dataset includes 262 transcribed small group conversations over 39,000+ speaker turns.
Conversations come from 16 unique conversation collections. Each collection was a conversation series hosted in partnership between [Cortico](https://cortico.ai/), a national non-profit, and one or more organizations. 

Collections in the corpus are wide-ranging in the conversation purpose and topics covered. Collections include conversations about city manager selection, resourcing challenges in NYC during COVID-19, and challenges to Maine school districts.
Extended collection descriptions and any public links to additional information are publicly available in this [sheet.](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus/blob/main/Fora%20corpus%20-%20collection%20information.csv)

Beyond publicly available collection-level information in this [sheet](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus/blob/main/Fora%20corpus%20-%20collection%20information.csv), the Fora corpus includes transcribed speaker turns for every conversation in the corpus, annotations for a 25% sample of the conversations, and an example conversation guide for each conversation collection. These resources are provided through an access agreement for use in research, described in a later section.

## Annotations: personal sharing and facilitation strategies

Over 25% of the conversations have been manually annotated for two types of personal sharing, and seven defined facilitation strategies.

### Personal sharing
1. Personal story
A personal story describes a specific series of events that happened in the speaker's life. Usually, this story happened in the past, but it may be happening in the present. Stories can be as short as one sentence.
Examples:
* `I rode my bike all across town until I found that darn hospital!`
* `10 years ago, I went to the coroner's office after my brother passed away. They would not help me find out what happened.`
2. Personal experience
A mention of personal experience includes the mention of of professional background, or general statements about the speaker's life that are *not* a sequence of specific events, unlike stories described above.
Examples:
* `I get mistaken for a lot of other Asian people in my sorority or in other sororities.` (This describes a recurring experience, so it's not a story but it is a personal experience.)
* `My name is Justyce, I am a student at UW Madison, and I'm a senior.` (This shares background information about the speaker that relates to their personal identity, but is not a story.)


### Facilitation strategies

A codebook and examples for each type of sharing and facilitator sharing strategy is included in this repository.

## Fora Corpus Access

Access will be managed through an agreement with the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). When the corpus goes live, access will be managed through [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3o8RqPcE_cxcvQ5Zfm5MC4KrlSa3JHxtYrUFZb5FjkLMEBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) form, and we will aim to handle access requests within a week.
