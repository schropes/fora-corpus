# Fora Corpus

This repository contains information about the Fora corpus, including a description of the data, information about requesting access, starter code, and models for processing the data.

The corpus is described in the ACL 2024 paper "Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" by Hope Schroeder, Deb Roy, and Jad Kabbara.

## The corpus

This dataset includes 262 transcribed small group conversations over 39,000+ speaker turns.
Conversations come from 16 unique conversation collections. Each collection was a conversation series hosted in partnership between [Cortico](https://cortico.ai/), a national non-profit, and one or more organizations. 

Collections in the corpus are wide-ranging in the conversation purpose and topics covered. Collections include conversations about city manager selection, resourcing challenges in NYC during COVID-19, and challenges to Maine school districts.
Extended collection descriptions and any public links to additional information are publicly available in this [sheet.](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus/blob/main/Fora%20corpus%20-%20collection%20information.csv)

Beyond publicly available collection-level information in this [sheet](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus/blob/main/Fora%20corpus%20-%20collection%20information.csv), the Fora corpus includes transcribed speaker turns for every conversation in the corpus, annotations for a 25% sample of the conversations, and an example conversation guide for each conversation collection. These resources are provided through an access agreement for use in research, described in a later section.

## Fora annotations

Over 25% of the conversations have been manually annotated for two types of personal sharing, and seven defined facilitation strategies.



A codebook and examples for each type of sharing and facilitator sharing strategy is included in this repository.

## Fora Corpus Access

Access will be managed through an agreement with the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). When the corpus goes live, access will be managed through [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3o8RqPcE_cxcvQ5Zfm5MC4KrlSa3JHxtYrUFZb5FjkLMEBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) form, and we will aim to handle access requests within a week.
