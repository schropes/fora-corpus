Maine ED 2050,150,76,"What skills and capacities do our youth need from their education to thrive in the Maine of 2050?
The Maine ED 2050 project engages students, parents, educators, community members, and industry leaders to imagine the Maine of the future — what is coming toward us now and what we value and want to strive for. It asks Mainers to consider what it means to thrive personally, civically, and economically in their community now and how that might change in the future. It also asks Mainers to consider what those visions might mean for schooling in particular.

What skills and capacities are needed?

How are those skills and capacities best developed?

Where and with whom are those skills and capacities best developed?

The project is iterative in that these questions will never be “answered.” The discussions will evolve as community needs shift, technology advances, the environment changes, and our society progresses. Maine ED 2050 is a place to meet each other to discuss, grapple, expand our understanding, imagine, and ultimately contribute to the ongoing conversation about school’s role and value in our society. Maine ED 2050 brings the people together for meaningful, small group, guided discussions on these topics and gathers their voices into white papers and reports as well as provides an online platform for their stories to be heard by all.

Why is this Important?
Education is how our young people learn to sustain and evolve our communities toward desired futures, and it necessarily needs to evolve itself in order to provide newer generations with the knowledge and ways of thinking and being appropriate to their task. School is only one of the ways we become educated, but it is an important one. Family, our legal system, arts and culture, social media, and even the natural environment all provide education. But our public schools are a place where all students come to learn to create the future, our future, together. In a democratic society, the importance of “together” can’t be overstated. To educate ourselves together in common schools requires sharing a common vision for what it means to flourish, what that will look like and require in the future of our communities, and what young people need to know, be, and be able to do to facilitate that future flourishing. We, the people, together, can inform the work of local school boards as well as state education agencies in maintaining and evolving our systems of schooling. Without a meaningful voice, we can feel disconnected from public schools as well as disillusioned about their work. For public schooling to remain relevant and trustworthy, its evolution needs to be both purposeful and transparent and also guided by a diversity of meaningfully engaged Maine people. 


Maine Education 2050 provides an on-ramp to participation for everyone and lifts their voices to be heard by the public and decision-makers at all levels, building trust and hope through engagement and increasing common understanding and the social good will necessary for successful democratic governance.

75-minute, small group discussions are held virtually or in-person. They are generally organized by school or county for youth, parents and community, and educators and across counties for statewide industry and non-profit sector groups.

United Way of Dane County,24,43,"As United Way of Dane County prepared for their 100th anniversary, they partnered with Cortico to gather 100 conversations to inform planning for their next 100 years.

United Way of Dane County trained 25 community stakeholders to facilitate virtual 90-minute LVN conversations in order to collect diverse stories, experiences, and perspectives from the Dane County community. United Way did focused outreach to community members who have worked their way through financial challenges, such as eviction or homelessness, unemployment or a lack of access to quality, affordable childcare to ensure the voices of people most impacted by those issues in our community were centered in these conversations.

United Way of Dane County is listening to and lifting-up diverse voices in the community – because they know more than anyone what they need. They will use what they learn to realign their efforts and funding priorities to best serve the community as a part of their Centennial Celebration.",United Way of Dane County,https://cortico.ai/partners/united-way-of-dane-county/
NYC Community Voices: COVID-19 & Beyond,200,22,"A Call to Action from NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene's (NYC DoHMH's) Public Health Corps (PHC)
In June 2022, Cortico submitted a response to this RFP shared by The Fund for Public Health on behalf of New York City’s Department of Health & Mental Hygiene to support the Public Health Corps (PHC) in documenting the experiences of community members served. The RFP called for “a sustainable community-based resource library that will enable community partners to share the personal stories of COVID-19 health impact and recovery.”
Over the course of four months from August - November, Cortico worked closely with Sarah Searfoss (Communications Manager, NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene) and Zoe Sakas (Social Epidemiologist, Monitoring & Evaluation, NYC Department of Health) with additional advising and support from Dr. Olusimbo Ige, Assistant Commissioner, Center for Health Equity and Community Wellness, NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. 
Project Summary:
100+ people from across 35 historically underserved NYC neighborhoods joined 28 recorded small group conversations. 13 PHC community-based organization partners led this process – designing questions, facilitating conversations, and reaching out to local participants. We used tools and methods developed by the MIT Center for Constructive Communication and introduced by the non-profit Cortico to highlight, analyze, and share insights from these conversations.
Goal
The purpose of this project was to develop tools and organize culturally and linguistically appropriate story collection processes in collaboration with PHC community-based organizations (CBOs) to document the individual COVID-19 stories of community resilience and resourcing, stories of vaccine experiences and decisions, and visions for the future of our collective health. The output will be an enduring resource, a living story repository  that will support CBOs and the NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (NYC DoHMH) in communicating the impact of the PHC.

For the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Public Narrative and LVN teamed up for a conversation event. For participants who are Deaf and hard of hearing, we utilized a combination of ASL interpretation and Closed Captioning on Zoom. For ASL interpreters we used the “Spotlight Video” function in Zoom by right clicking on the video of the ASL interpreter or clicking the ellipsis in their video screen.

EGI Conversations,196,19,"The Community Engagement Team is using Cortico to provide a process and technology that invites, records, and shares community experiences, especially for those who have been historically underserved and underrepresented. 

The tool supports community members' ability to influence City decision-making. It removes some barriers to equitable community engagement by amplifying the voices of residents who tend to shy away from large community forums, decline to take surveys or prefer to share thoughts and ideas in small group settings amongst peers. 

We continue to add conversations to the database. In the meantime, see a few highlights from our discussions below. Be sure to follow us on Facebook to receive the latest updates.",City of Durham,https://behearddurham.portal.lvn.org/
Cambridge City Manager Selection Project,147,18,"In early 2022 the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts announced that after six years of service, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale was set to retire in July.

A high-ranking position, the City Manager is responsible for providing leadership to and administration of all City departments and services including Intergovernmental, Human Resource and Development, General Government Public Safety, Community Maintenance, and Development and Education.

Cambridge is a rapidly growing city characterized by academic prowess and a highly diverse populace, and all eyes were on the selection process for a new City Manager—a job assigned to the 9 members of the Cambridge City Council.

To begin the process, the City Council hired an out-of-state consulting firm to run the search. But with such a high stakes decision and a desire that the choice reflect the diverse needs of the City’s residents, council members and other government officials realized they had to dig deeper.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui agreed: The consulting firm alone “does not have experience with Cambridge specifically, nor do they have experience with doing the extensive community outreach engagement that the search requires.”

The new plan was to bring in additional community engagement groups to hear public priorities—one of which was Cortico.

Cortico worked with council members to develop a series of small, issue-based dialogues using Cortico’s technology. These 90-minute recorded conversations brought in critical actors in local affairs. These conversations were designed to elicit deep, issue-based, feedback from residents and stakeholders on what the next City Manager should bring to the job and to reveal current challenges and opportunities for progress. 
Through this partnership with Cortico, the City was able to demonstrate their desire and ability to listen to constituents in real time, adding a level of transparency that was previously unattainable. Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon herself used the LVN platform to make 100+ highlights, regularly sharing these conversation excerpts on her Twitter feed. Feedback from the conversations was used to form a leadership profile which outlined the role and helped recruit qualified candidates that fit the needs of the Cambridge community.

In May, the screening committee publicly shared the names and profiles of the four candidates being forwarded to the City Council for final consideration. Guided by the leadership profile created using Cortico, the City Council made their final decision on June 6 with a vote to make an offer of employment to Yi-An Huang. Huang was officially sworn in the following September. The Cortico platform continues to provide community feedback and insights to support the Cambridge City Council and Yi-An Huang in his new role.","City of Cambridge, MA",https://cortico.ai/partners/city-of-cambridge-ma/
Virtual Open Newsroom,28,13,"July’s round of The Virtual Open Newsroom was divided into three topics: rent, jobs and food. These three topics came out of the discussions that took place in our first round of virtual meetings in May. During those conversations, we found that questions and concerns boiled down to eight topics. While all issues are important, we had to narrow them as a group so we could decide what to focus on. We asked folks to prioritize which of those topics were top of mind via an online poll. Those ended up being: rent, jobs and food. 

At this month’s Virtual Open Newsroom, in partnership with Local Voices Network, we divided our 50+ attendees into smaller rooms to discuss rent, jobs and food. We played a word association game. We asked participants to tell us five words they associated with rent, jobs or food — depending on what meeting they attended. After that, we asked attendees to associate a single feeling word with their previous five words.

Cap Times People's Agenda,73,6,"For the 2020 elections, the Cap Times is developing a People's Agenda to help guide the stories we cover, and we want to hear what’s important to you. This isn’t about what the candidates want to discuss — it’s about the community setting its priorities.
What do you want local and national candidates to be talking about as they compete for votes this year? What are the problems you most want solved and the questions you most want answered? 

Your answers will help the Cap Times decide how to report on elections and policy issues in Madison and Wisconsin. It’s especially helpful if you can give your answers in the form of questions so that we don’t have to guess what you mean. For example, “What can our city do to slow climate change while still operating within our budget?” gives us more to go on than simply “climate change.”

Digital Coverage of Crime & Justice Conversations,81,6,"In November 2019, AL.com began examining its reporting on crime and justice. As part of that ongoing conversation, AL.com recently announced that it will no longer use mugshots in any capacity in most of its crime coverage. A crime reporter who is part of the team in Huntsville has shifted her coverage from the day-to-day to questions of justice and fairness to understand what could be revealed through a different editorial lens.  And a columnist is engaging in research related to this topic as a Neiman Fellow at Harvard in the 2020-21 year. 


With the national outcry for more equitable reporting on crime and criminal justice, AL.com seeks to engage the state’s residents in conversation about what they want, need, value and wish for in criminal justice reporting. LVN will work with AL.com to engage with Huntsville residents in a pilot project to gather feedback and insights for us in informing and guiding  reporting and editorial decisions for the state’s largest, most-read  media organization.

Foundation for Black Women's Wellness,37,6,"The Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness (FFBWW) is building a policy platform around what Black women need to be a well Black woman in Wisconsin. Cortico partnered with FFBWW to help amplify existing conversations about the topics of healthcare, racism, and barriers to access that the Foundation was already gathering.

Cortico trained staff, ambassadors and volunteers to facilitate conversations that would center Black women’s concerns, experiences and hopes. The stories shared have already informed the Foundation’s programmatic offerings and strategic direction, and also proven to be a critical tool for advocating on behalf of community members whose voices are often overlooked, particularly around health and wellness.

Ultimately, the themes that run through these stories will inform the creation of the Foundation’s policy platform, which will be shared on a public website alongside the policy recommendations. The stories have already been well received in public presentations, in both community and academic contexts, as a humanizing complement to quantitative data. The Foundation hopes to integrate them into white papers, an article for a medical journal, and in grantseeking efforts.",Foundation for Black Women's Wellness,"https://cortico.ai/partners/foundation-for-black-women-s-wellness/#:~:text=Cortico%20partnered%20with%20FFBWW%20to,women's%20concerns%2C%20experiences%20and%20hopes."

Police & Fire Commission Conversations,70,5,"The unexpected retirement announcement of Madison’s long-serving Chief of Police in early 2020 presented the city’s Police and Fire Commission (PFC) a unique opportunity: to address the long-standing issue of distrust of law enforcement, particularly among residents from marginalized communities. PFC decided to use a range of methods to engage residents in informing the next critical hire for the Chief of Police. The process kicked into high gear in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, and the pressure on the city to respond to residents’ concerns was heightened.

PFC partnered with Cortico to pull perspectives from seven Local Voices Network conversations about the relationship between law enforcement and communities, featuring 48 residents, in addition to other outreach strategies, such as community listening sessions and through online surveys. The stories shared in those conversations were immensely powerful – detailing experiences with police brutality, lack of community trust, and racial segregation in Madison.

In addition to offering city officials the opportunity to hear from residents who they might not otherwise, a new tech-assisted sense-making process was piloted to surface themes of lived experience related to public safety and policing. These themes were then systematically summarized and translated into suggested interview questions. Several of these questions were used in public interviews of the final four candidates for Police Chief. This approach demonstrates the possibility of bringing people and technology together in a new way for a more inclusive and transparent process of leadership selection. The PFC project represents how community voices can be included in public processes in meaningful and healing ways.",City of Madison,https://cortico.ai/partners/city-of-madison-police-and-fire-commission/
